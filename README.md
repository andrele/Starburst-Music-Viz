Starburst-Music-Viz
===================

Just attended a great workshop at a Carnegie Mellon mini-symposium called Eliciting Environments organized by the School of Architecture. In just a few hours, Michael Szivos with Madeline Gannon got us up to speed on basic sound analysis with Processing and how to visualize music in our work.  http://elicitingenvironments.org/workshops  

This was a quick experiment in using SoundFlower, Processing, ControlP5, Minim, and FFT to create a an audio visualization with simple circular shapes. The sliders control the audio threshold, the stroke minimum, and the stroke maximum.  
What I found very interesting was when I entered negative values for the ellipse stroke width. What you end up with is some really interesting starburst effects. Awesome! :)
